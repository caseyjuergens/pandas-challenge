Observable Trends

In this data set, most of the players are males. Coming in at 84% of the total players, men make up an overwhelming majority of the clientele.

Roughly 3/4ths of the clientele fall between the ages of 15-29. Out of the 8 age groups, the 20-24 age bracket is certainly the largest at 44.8%.

The 20-24 year olds generate the most sales, with the total purchase value at $1114.06 â€“ 47% of the total revenue. This data makes sense, seeing as the 20-24 age bracket makes up almost half of the clientele as well. However, they do not have the highest average total purchase per person. The 35-39 age bracket have the highest average per person total, coming in at $4.76, while the 20-24 year olds average $4.32.
